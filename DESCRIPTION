Description: The ERPplot pacakge has been developed at National Cheng Kung
    University to provide functions most useful for Event-related brain potential
    (ERP) data analysis. ERP data analysis is considered in a standard linear
    model setting, and We implement a set of functions in R to facilitate visual
    exploration of data and display of statistical testing results. These R
    functions are based on ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2009) to enable step-by-step
    revision of graphic objects.
